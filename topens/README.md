Automation of the Topens Roll Off Roof 

With the kindness of Mark Sproul, we are attempting to adapt his AlpacaPi software, which was first developed to automate his observatory.

We are attempting to automate a 8'X10" roll off observatory with a Topens gate opener using a pair magnetic switches and a Raspberry Pi.

The [Topens gate opener](https://topens.com/products/topens-rk990t-automatic-sliding-gate-opener-rack-drive-electric-gate-motor-for-heavy-driveway-slide-gate-up-to-2200-pounds) is designed for a heavy duty sliding gate up to max 2200lbs. in weight. It is powered by 110-120VAC.

The model I choice is the RK990(T).  The user manual is located [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0613/5427/9162/files/C030421_RK990_T__EN_20221107.pdf?v=1668041619)
